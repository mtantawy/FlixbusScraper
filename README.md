# FlixbusScraper
Scraper for Flixbus using Headless-Chrome as an experiment.

## Getting Headless Chrome Up&Running
```
google-chrome-stable --disable-gpu --headless --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

### Notice
This is just an experiment/example for using Headless Chrome, probably the same job can be achieved in a much better way.
